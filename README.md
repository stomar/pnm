PNM - A Ruby library for PNM image files (PBM, PGM, PPM)
========================================================

PNM is a pure [Ruby][Ruby] library for creating, reading,
and writing of `PNM` image files (Portable Anymap):

- `PBM` (Portable Bitmap),
- `PGM` (Portable Graymap), and
- `PPM` (Portable Pixmap).

It is a portable and lightweight utility for exporting or importing
of raw pixel data to or from an image file format that can be processed
by most image manipulation programs.

PNM comes without any dependencies on other gems or native libraries.

Examples
--------

Create a PGM grayscale image from a two-dimensional array of gray values:

``` ruby
require "pnm"

# pixel data
pixels = [[ 0, 10, 20],
          [10, 20, 30]]

# create the image object
image = PNM.create(pixels)

# create the image with additional optional settings
image = PNM.create(pixels, maxgray: 30, comment: "Test Image")

# retrieve some image properties
image.info    # => "PGM 3x2 Grayscale"
image.type    # => :pgm
image.width   # => 3
image.height  # => 2
```

Note that for PBM bilevel images a pixel value of 0 signifies white
(and 1 signifies black), whereas for PGM and PPM images a value of 0
signifies black.

See PNM.create for a more detailed description of pixel data formats
and available options.

Write an image to a file:

``` ruby
image.write("test.pgm")
image.write_with_extension("test")  # adds the correct file extension

# use ASCII or "plain" format (default is binary)
image.write("test.pgm", :ascii)

# write to an I/O stream
File.open("test.pgm", "w") {|f| image.write(f) }
```

Read an image from a file (returns a PNM::Image object):

``` ruby
image = PNM.read("test.pgm")
image.comment  # => "Test Image"
image.maxgray  # => 30
image.pixels   # => [[0, 10, 20], [10, 20, 30]]
```

Force an image type:

``` ruby
color_image = PNM.create([[0, 1],[1, 0]], type: :ppm)
color_image.info  # => "PPM 2x2 Color"
```

Check equality of two images:

``` ruby
color_image == image  # => false
```
